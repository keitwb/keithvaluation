     <div class="contenttitle">Advantages of Business Valuation and Real Estate Together</div>
     <p>In many businesses, the largest single asset owned by the firm or the shareholders may be the real estate.&nbsp; It is important when selling a business that the owner understand the value of the real estate and its importance in the operation of the business. &nbsp;Many businesses are extremely dependent on location.&nbsp; These businesses, such as fast food restaurants and convenience stores, tend to be more sensitive to traffic flow. Other businesses, while somewhat dependent on location, may be more dependent on being in a certain area, but less dependent on traffic flow. These businesses include retail establishments such as furniture stores or apparel retailers. Other business, such as service businesses, may have no dependence on the actual physical location.</p>
      <p>It is important when selling a business to understand not only the dependence of the business on location, but also the values and alternate uses of the real estate.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>There are times when the business itself may not support the real estate it occupies.&nbsp; For example, a plumbing company may have been at the same location for 30 years, whereby the company owns the land free and clear.&nbsp; However, if the owner is planning to sell the business, it may be more beneficial to sell the real estate separate from the business and relocate the business to a location with lower market rent.</p>
      <p>In many cases, an interested buyer of a company may on be interested in the customer list or the brand name of the product sold by the firm.&nbsp; This is generally known as a "strategic" or "synergistic" sale.&nbsp; The interested buyer may wish to relocate the operations of the existing firm without interest in the real estate owned by the current owners.&nbsp; It is important that the selling party understand the alternate uses and value of the real estate. </p>
