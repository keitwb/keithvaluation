I am 40 years old and was ready to settle down to a career I could enjoy the rest of my life.\n\nA former associate of the firm, Diehl Jones, had recommended me to this firm because they had an excellent training program and had trained over 60 appraisers in this market. I had checked with other firms but they were not willing to take on an associate who would eventually become their competition.\n\nSince being hired, I have appraised numerous properties including office park developments, medical clinics, fast food and family style restaurants, churches, central business district office and retail, office condos, industrial properties, farm and woodland and hospitals. At first there were a lot of questions but now I am getting more familiar with the appraisal process and now I am beginning to \"see the light.\" This has been one of the most rewarding careers I have every pursued and I hope to continue this until I retire.\n\nThe firm has excellent data bases and the assignments become more interesting and challenging each day. I learn something new each day and with each assignment."

            "content": "Recently Jim Bullard completed a study on the effects of a median that was placed along Ramsey Street in 2011.  After establishing the traffic history for Ramsey Street and discussing the reasons for the median with the NC Department of Transportation, Bullard compiled an exhaustive study of businesses along Ramsey Street and documented the results of this study in order to demonstrate the effects of the median on various types of businesses.\n\nThe owners and managers of over forty businesses were asked \"How has the median affected your business”?  Next, the owners were asked to discuss the effects if any on how much their businesses had changed.  The information gleaned was incorporated into a study which graphically illustrates how the major types of businesses were affected by the median."

            "content": "Nearly 7 years ago I made a career change from teaching music at Methodist University with a Doctorate in Music to pursuing a career in real estate appraising. I knew nothing about appraising but an appraisal firm owners’ son took piano lessons from my wife who taught at Snyder Memorial Baptist Church. I interviewed with the owner and he agreed to hire me provided I took the required courses for a trainee license and a real estate broker’s license. After completing the required three years of appraisal experience with Tom J. Keith & Associates, Inc. I took the required appraisal licensing test and obtained my General Real Estate Appraisers License.\n\nTom Keith has trained over 60 appraisers during his 42 years experience and he knows how to train appraisers by providing the individual with just the right amount of assistance with hands-on on-the-job training and education and at the same time instilling in us the pride of authorship and the satisfaction of completing the job on our own for the client. He conducted weekly staff meetings so all appraisers could share their experiences to help the beginning appraiser.  He has about 20,000 appraisal reports, models, transaction data, and a wealth of knowledge about how to appraise any type of property a client may request. I never experienced a situation where he did not know how to appraise a property.  He was always available to help me with any question I might have.  He allowed me to continue to pursue musical interest at night. I even helped my children with home schooling.\n\nMy family are moving to Pennsylvania and my experience with Mr. Keith has enabled me to launch an appraisal career with a health care appraisal firm. I owe my success in this business because I had the opportunity to work for a firm that strives on doing things \"the right way” and doing them like you would like someone to appraise your property."

            "content": "For the past five years Yolanda Lilly, GIS technician,  has helped Tom J. Keith and Associates leverage the capacity of the GIS program to relate different types of data such as socioeconomic, demographic and land use data to strengthen studies, consultations and reports with professional illustrations of geographically based empirical data, providing a more complete overview of a client’s specific property(s) within the whole universe of data for that market.  The ArcGIS program and 36” plotter allows her to graphically plot data on maps and charts for easier visual presentation and interpretation. The program can create maps, mine data from the whole universe of data in a market, and maintain data to assist the appraisers in locating their subject and comparables for their appraisal or consulting  reports. When a bid request for an appraisal report is received and accepted, the first thing to do is locate the subject with the aid of the GIS program. She creates different maps such as aerial, topography, elevation, flood zone, floodway, soil, wetlands and location maps to provide the client and appraisers with a more complete understanding of the subject property(s).  Once the subject is identified, the GIS program is combined with geographically referenced data that allows her to research for recent improved and/or land sales.\n\nBy executing search techniques within the GIS program,  Mrs. Lilly performs research in selected markets for properties with certain characteristics and exports that data to an Excel spreadsheet or generates a map with the data plotted on it. The geographic data comes from a variety of government and corporate sources and daily inquiries are made to stay current by updating and maintaining the program and data files to ensure the most accurate performance of the GIS program and database.   The GIS program has the capacity to relate different types of data such as socioeconomic, demographic, and land use that allows contribution to those different studies and consultations which allows the appraisers to visualize the relationship between physical, social, and economic characteristics and trends."

We were chosen because of our knowledge and experience in valuing both real estate and business entities. The three and one-half day course introduces the participant to the concept of appraising real estate properties with a business component, such as car washes and motels. It is designed to provide the experienced appraiser the knowledge and understanding needed to perform going concern valuations by helping the real estate appraiser identify the non-real estate and intangible assets when they are entangled with the real estate.\n\nThe course is developed from the book Going Concern Valuations for Real Estate Appraisers, Lenders, Assessors, and Eminent Domain Professionals written by L. Deane Wilson, MA, ASA and Robin G. Wilson, MAI."
